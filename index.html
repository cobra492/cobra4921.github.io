						<h1 style=color:goldenrod>Nice to meet you</h1>
                            <p> Hello, my name is Kyle.  I am a fourth year English and professional writing student. I have written I am an aspiring author as well as a web author and content creator.  </p> 
<p>  I recently got into content creation when I had a post on TikTok go viral, and developed video editing skills. I have created several different vlogs, as well as review on Wattpad. I am interested in continuing to hone my video editing skills as well as content creations. I have several different ideas for social media, such as fashion blogs, movie review blogs, and even posting funny videos and edits. I would love to vlog for either fashion, or gaming companies as well as possibly do anything in PR that involves digital authoring.  </p> 
<p>Despite having a shaky relationship with computers, I may or may not have geek squad on speed dial, with hard work and determination, and a few casualties, I have developed a better understanding of computers. </p> 
<p>I first got into being a web author when I was in middle school. It started out with me writing about some of my favourite characters from some of my favourite books, like Percy Jackson and Hunger games, as well as tv shows, like Totally spies and Kim possible.  I used to post them on Wattpad, but there is no evidence of that, I made sure. We all have a past we are not proud of.   </p> 
 <p>Despite my past with computers, I continue to not only vlog and do social media as well as create write short stories that even got me accepted into the creative writing program at York.  </p>
